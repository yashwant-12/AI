## New version !

This folder was changed as there was only 3 source files, now there exists **V1_SOURCE** and **V2_SOURCE** where the **V1** contains the original files (not recommended to use), and the **V2** contains the new version of the project that adapts an **OOP** approach and a cleaner code structure, as well as some enhancements along with some new features.

**What's new?**

- OOP approach
- The 3D model is only redrawn (rerendered) when there's a change 
- Faces are now being drawn **completely** (no matter how many vetrecies)
- Points that aren't in the screen are no longer rendered
- Rotation isn't continous, instead it's a custom degree on each axis
- New controls for Line color, Filling color, canvas color
- Filling could be turned ON and OFF

## Description

This project was made as a practice for Python programming, Matrix manipulation, file processing, and general system engineering processes.

Also it was a way for me to explore an interesting field for me which is graphics (2D, and 3D).

It's a desktop app that takes in waveform files (.OBJ) and visualizes its triangulated form ~(no filliing, no shading, no texturing! just triangles)~ 

The **V2** (Legacy_versions/V2_SOURCE) of the project adds a filling option with control over the color of the filling as well as whether it's turned ON or OFF.

### Key Words

- Python: Numpy, Tkinter, re (regex), 3D graphics.

- Waveform files (.OBJ).

## Disclamer

This article assumes having basic knowledge of Python, Tkinter, and Numpy, since these will not be covered here.

**About waveform files (.OBJ)**, I recommend reading this [article in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file).

Or if you're not into reading, watch this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMWUjNE0fYI)

## How to use

### Dependecies:

**New contribution**: Our friend [@http-samc](https://github.com/http-samc) added *requirements.txt* to the project and made it easier to install all dependencies (this is the preferred way to do this) through running this command ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```.

---

You'll have to have these libraries along with Python in your PC ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` :

- Numpy

- Tkinter (if you're running Linux, you'll have to install it ```sudo apt-get install python3-tk``` , otherwise, it comes with Python when installed)

- The 3 files provided in this repo located in the same folder.

- pyscreenshot (Only if you're running Linux, otherwise, you can use ImageGrab from the PIL lib)

### Manipulation

- Run the main.py file

- This interface will open:

- You can load any .obj file you want, or you can choose from the files 
provided in the /Objects folder.

- After loading the 3D model, you can move it UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT using the U/D/L/R buttons or using the arrow keys on your keyboard.

- You can zoom in and out, or rotate the model in 3 axis.

- You can take screenshots too with the "Take screenshot" button.

**New in V2**

- You can turn ON and OFF the filling.

- You can change the canvas color, the lines color, and the filling color.
